TO DO on The Lich's Code

Development on The Lich's Code has ceased, Malediction Games (still just me at the moment) is working on its next major project. 

PRIORITY
<none>

NOMINAL
<none>

IF TIME
<none>


COMPLETED
Increase Spawner Limit (! add a per-spawner minimum to avoid 'empty on activation' spawners)
UI Improvement
Correct Death Emission for Spawners (uses Seeker color/size)
Pause on Victory unpauses (the toggle doesn't check for pause)
Injured Arm Color
Finish East Level
Add Attack & Death sounds
Add Audio Controller
Volume Control UI Does Not Synch (each slider starts at 50)
Clean Up Documentation (Doing final documentation pass now)
Push To GitHub (If this is in the Completed section, and you can read it, clearly I did this)

DISCARDED
Rewrite Difficulty code to allow in-game changing. (Requires Pause System rewrite, not worth it for small feature).
Restrict Mouse Cursor to Game Screen (Minor out-clicking is less troublesome than 'getting stuck' in the game window)
Add Kill Counter, Fix Slight Slide Toward Edges, & Fix 'head bumping' slowdown when levitating under a block (Moving on to a non-free project has taken priority)
