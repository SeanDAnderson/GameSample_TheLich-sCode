TO DO on The Lich's Code

PRIORITY
Add Attack & Death sounds
Finish East Level

NOMINAL
UI Improvement

IF TIME
Slight Slide Toward Edges
Volume Control UI Does Not Synch (each slider starts at 50)

COMPLETED
Increase Spawner Limit (! add a per-spawner minimum to avoid 'empty on activation' spawners)
Fix 'head bumping' slowdown when levitating under a block
Correct Death Emission for Spawners (uses Seeker color/size)
Pause on Victory unpauses (the toggle doesn't check for pause)
Injured Arm Color

Discarded
Rewrite Difficulty code to allow in-game changing. (Requires Pause System rewrite, not worth it for small feature).
