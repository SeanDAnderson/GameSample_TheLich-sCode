TO DO on The Lich's Code

PRIORITY
Clean Up Documentation
Push To GitHub



NOMINAL
Add Kill Counter

IF TIME
Fix Slight Slide Toward Edges
Fix 'head bumping' slowdown when levitating under a block (thought it was fixed, but no)

COMPLETED
Increase Spawner Limit (! add a per-spawner minimum to avoid 'empty on activation' spawners)
UI Improvement
Correct Death Emission for Spawners (uses Seeker color/size)
Pause on Victory unpauses (the toggle doesn't check for pause)
Injured Arm Color
Finish East Level
Add Attack & Death sounds
Add Audio Controller
Volume Control UI Does Not Synch (each slider starts at 50)

DISCARDED
Rewrite Difficulty code to allow in-game changing. (Requires Pause System rewrite, not worth it for small feature).
Restrict Mouse Cursor to Game Screen (Minor out-clicking is less troublesome than 'getting stuck' in the game window)
